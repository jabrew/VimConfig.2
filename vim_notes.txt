= Completion plugins =

- coc seems nice, but fails simple cases with pyls - try jedi
  - e.g. Open ~/test.py from any non-~ folder
- ncm2 and deoplete require python3
- TabNine seems interesting, but expensive
  - tbodt/deoplete-tabnine
  - https://tabnine.com

= Coc =

- https://github.com/neoclide/coc-highlight - highlight current symbol
- https://github.com/neoclide/coc-sources
- https://github.com/neoclide/coc-yank - highlight yanked text
- https://github.com/neoclide/coc-git - async git gutter update

= Ncm2 =

Can potentially try with language server
- https://github.com/Microsoft/python-language-server
- https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp
- ncm2 + vim-lsp - https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/issues/36
- ncm2 float-window - stop auto close
Conflicts with <CR> mappings
- https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/issues/129
- https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2/issues/163

= Pair plugins =

- Very few plugins support .
- jiangmiao/auto-pairs is new version of the one in _vimrc. Supports . as long as <CR> never pressed
- delimitMate may have support for .
- Pear-tree - may have fixed bugs after 6/1

= Statusline =

- Investigate other statusline plugins
 - https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline
 - https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim
 - https://github.com/powerline/powerline - heavy weight, but works in zsh too

= Unit Tests/Build =

- dispatch.vim
- https://github.com/janko/vim-test
  - Config example / terminal strategy - https://github.com/zenbro/dotfiles/blob/master/.nvimrc#L151-L187
- https://github.com/alfredodeza/pytest.vim
  - Seems to only be py.test
- Built in: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Integration_with_PyUnit_testing_framework
  - :compiler , :make
- NeoMake will add signs
- Ale
  - Add fixer
  - Bind ALENext/ALEPrevious

= Tags =

- gtags
  - gutentags_plus
  - gtags should be like ctags but much faster to access - not constrained to flat text format
  - May also allow indexing e.g. tensorflow code
- Dynamic tag highlight
  - Selected semshi - way more dynamic and full featured, but probably slower
  - Neotags.nvim - https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/53mdj9/neotagsnvim_tag_highlight_in_neovim/
    - But integrate with gutentags
    - Focus on speed - e.g. c++ module to parse tags file, etc
  - EasyTags - but long time since last update

= Other =

- https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons
- vim-operator-replace - replace selected text with clipboard

= Tips =

- Ctrl-f during a search - show search history
